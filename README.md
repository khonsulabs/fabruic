# fabruic

Fabruic is a wrapper around [quinn](https://lib.rs/quinn) that provides a
simplified interface for reliable payload delivery.

This project is written to support Khonsu Labs projects, primarily
[Cosmic Verge](https://github.com/khonsulabs/cosmicverge) and
[PliantDB](https://github.com/khonsulabs/pliantdb).

While this library is open-source, the primary reason for publishing on
crates.io is to support releasing PliantDB. If you're considering using this for
your own project, please recognize that this project is offered as-is and if
there are features you are wishing to have that we do not need in one of our
projects, we may not add them. Before submitting a PR, please submit your ideas
as an issue first to ensure it aligns with our vision, otherwise the PR may not
be accepted.

## Open-source Licenses

This project, like all projects from [Khonsu Labs](https://khonsulabs.com/), are
open-source. This repository is available under the [MIT License](./LICENSE-MIT)
or the [Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE-APACHE).
